When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them, your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade"
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?"

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times, I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
